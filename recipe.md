How to amke red velvet game......


 step 1.     First preheat your oven to 350 F (176 C).        Next let's make our cake batter.Start by creaming your better and your white granulated or caster sugar together in a large bowl.Use a hand mixer or stand mixer to do this.

 step2. Now we add in our eggs one at a time .So drop one egg in, mix once that egg is completly incrorporated do the other egg.Make sure to scrape the side o the bowl with a spatula.


 step3. Now we add in our cococa powde.It is a good idea to run it through some kind of a difter.Cocoa Powder  tends to get a bit lumpy.Then mix again and scrpae the slide as needed.Throught this whole process we don't want to over mix, just until things are inccorportesd.If we mix too much we will add too much air into the batter which can cause air pockets on our cak.

 step4. Now add in your vanilla extract to your buttermilk as well as your white vinger.If you don't have buttermilk you can make some by taking just shy of one cup of regular milk and adding one tablespoon of lemon juice or vinger and then let it sit out for about 10 to 15 minutes.Stir iin the vinger and vinegar and vanilla extract until combined. 


 step5.  Now we add in our oil to the buttermilk mixture.Next add in obout 2 to 2 amd 1/2 tablesponns of red food color liquid.Then stir, until the mixture is a nice red color.set that mixture aside for now. 


 step.6. Next we will add our salt nd baking soda to our flour .You can use cake flour ar all-purpose flour.cake tends to work a littel bit better, but all-purpose works great  too .Use a whisk combine those ingredients. 


 step7. Next we will add in about half of our food coloring buttermilk mixture and about half of our flour mixture ,then turn on the mixture ad mix until just combined.Give the sides of the bowl the a good scrape, then complete the process until all the ingredients have been mixed leaving you with a nice red velvet cake batter. 


 step8.  Now we just fill upp two 9 inch or 8 ich cake pans with equal amounts of cake batter.Make sure to use shorting or kitchen spray on the pans and then dust them wiht cocoa powder or flour and i always add a littel round cut out of parchment paper on the bottom too as an added precautoion,and  my nonstick pans are great,but  i like to over-do it.Also it is a good idea to lightly tap the pans with the batter in it, This will allow any cake bubbles to rise to the top,which help to prevnt air pockets, but sometimes it is unavoidable and you just get them a, coombination of over mixing etc.But it won't effect the taste of the cake for 23 to 30 minutes until when a toothpcik comes out clean after pocking in the middle.



 step9. Now after the cakes come out of the of the oven let's leave them alonne and allow to cool in their pans for about 10minutes.After that we can remove them from their pans ,remove the parchment paper and then let the cakes cool completely on the track.Afterwards you can place the cakes in the fridge and let them chill,which helps wiht the frosting or just go into the frosting step now,it's totally up to you! 


 step10. Well now it is time to make our frosting,we will be using just few ingrated, cream cheese, butter,vanilla extract,and of course powdered sugar (confrectoner's sugar). 


 step11. Now combine the cream cheese,butter,and villian ectract into a large bwol and mix with a hand mixer until nice and smooth usally takes a few minutes. then slowly incoporate all of the powdered sugar.You may need more or less depending on the consistency that you want.Next just remove the beaters.Frosting is ready to go. At this point if the frosting is still too runny add more  powdered sugar, or just chill it for about 30 minutes before frosting that cake. 


 step12.  First we will trip the cake so it will be somewhat level.You can skip this step if you like.I just always use my braead knife to cut the top off of the top layer off as well,the end product will look a bit better.Next add a bunch of frosting to the middle,then layer the top layer of cake on.Then cover that whole cake with frosting. There are a variety of tools that you can use, I normally just suse my cake spatula.Once done put the cake in the fridge for about 30 minutes.This is optional, but I like to do it, allows the forsting to set a bit. 


 step13. Now I want to make a heart-shaped cakec topper.To do that I tk=ake my heart cookie cutter nd cut out a shape frome the middle of that piece of cake that i have.Then just place it on top of your cake.
 looks pretty neat right? 


 step14. Now take the rest of your leftover cake and crumble it up with your fingers.Then gently apply it do your cake side or om top or skip this step.It is tottaly up to you how you decorate your cake :) 
 use piping bag and pipe frosting around the top of your heart if you like.You are done! Now place the cake in the fridge for about 2 hours before serving.Enjoy!
